  - `classes` - Teacher's classes
  - `class_students` - Class enrollment
  - `activities` - Quizzes and games
  - `quiz_results` - Student scores
  - `student_achievements` - Badges and rewards

**File Created:**
- `/DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql` - Complete database setup with sample data

### 3. **Supabase Helper Functions** ✅
- Pre-built functions for all database operations
- Type-safe TypeScript interfaces
- Easy-to-use API

**File Created:**
- `/lib/supabase.ts` - Complete Supabase client with helpers for:
  - Authentication (signup, signin, signout, sessions)
  - Student data (progress, activities, quiz results, achievements)
  - Teacher data (classes, students, analytics)

### 4. **Documentation** ✅

**Created Files:**
- 📘 `/README.md` - Full project documentation
